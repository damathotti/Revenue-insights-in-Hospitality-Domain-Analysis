# Revenue Insights in AtliQ Hospitality 🌍💼

## 📊 Domain: Hospitality | 💰 Function: Revenue Management

Welcome to **Revenue Insights in Hospitality Domain**! This project focuses on generating valuable insights for **AtliQ Grands**, a chain of five-star hotels across India, to help them regain market share and revenue in the luxury and business hotel categories.

### 🏨 **Background:**
AtliQ Grands has been a prominent player in the hospitality industry for over **20 years**.

To counter this, AtliQ’s management decided to incorporate **Business and Data Intelligence** for better decision-making. With no in-house data analytics team, they hired an external service provider (you!) to generate insights from their historical data and mock-up dashboards.
